This Repository is a collection of modified Repositories originally created by Marcel License and modified by me

I did some testing with his code and it is really fine and sounds much better than expected, but he used a MIDI-Controller-Keyboard with specific CCs - and I donÂ´t have one of these.

Today, April 2021, there are a lot of options to create a small Synthesizer or Drumcomputer based on Arduino / Teensy but the Projects from Marcel have the best Price/Sound - Ratio.

I tried to strip down his projects to make them a bit more unspecific and that way, it could be a bit more easy for others to start with his code.

Schematics and other documents will be provided later.
