The Drum_Synth Sketch was used to MOD a Volca Beats.
The Volca Beats (Korg TM) now has two different Sounds-Sources, 1. the original Sounds and 2. a set of 10 PCM-Sounds partially controlled by the same Controls as the normal UI.

Not all functions are implemented yet but it works and creates some new colors of sound.
